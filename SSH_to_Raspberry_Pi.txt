Connect computer to same wifi as raspberry pi
 - Might need to use monitor and keyboard to access raspberry pi initially
 - Default is Luke's, Syenna's, or James's hotspot on phone

After connection to same wifi, open terminal
 - Type command "ssh hps@raspberrypi"
 - Password: hps

Once connected to raspberry pi type these commands to start code
 - cd ISR17/ISR17/
 - compile main_ard/main_ard.ino
 - upload main_ard/main_ard.ino
 - python3 gui.py

The code should now be uploaded and the gui should be functional
